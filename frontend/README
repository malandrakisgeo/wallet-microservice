This is the Angular frontend of the Wallet-Microservice app available on https://github.com/malandrakisgeo/walletMicroservice-backend .

The logic of the application is fairly simple.

A wallet (monetary account) holds the current balance for a person (in Dollars). The balance can be modified by registering transactions on the account, either debit
transactions (removing funds) or credit transactions (adding funds).
Each person is associated with one wallet only,  yet a wallet can be shared among several persons.
The backend is merely a wallet microservice that manages credit/debit transactions on behalf of users.

The frontend is deliberately simple, and by no means complete.
There are several bugs to be fixed, and further functionalities are on their way.

Meant to be used for educational purposes only.

Most of the .css is based on Bootstrap.
